Insert into user values("<First Name>","<Last Name>","<E-mail>","<Password>","<D.O.B.>","<Profile Pic>");

Login verification
$email = "<Acepted email>"
$password = "<Accepted password>"
if(Select * from users where email == $email and password == $password)
	Login successful
	$currentUserID = Select User_ID from users where email == $email and password == $password

	login failed

When the user searches for a friend (for new friend)
Select email,First Name,Last Name,D.O.B. from user Where Exists(Select * from users where email == "<Search value>");

Insert into friends values("<SelfID>","<Select User_ID from users where(Select email from user Where Exists(Select * from users where email == "<Search value>");
)>");

Assuming the design is somewhat like Whatsapp web
When the user clicks on one name (name of friend or group)
$friendID == Select User_ID from users where First Name = "<Displayed first name>" and Last Name = "<Displayed Last Name>";

Display chat between friends
Select Content from Message where (SenderId == $currentUserID and ReceiverID == $friendID) union (SenderId == $friendID and $currentUserID) order by timestamp;

When user clicks on group name
$groupId = Select GroupId from groups where group name ="<displayed name>";

Display group chat
Select content from groupchat where groupid = $groupid order by timestamp;

Send message on group
Insert into groupchat values("<$currentUserID>","<$groupmember>(excluding the sender)","<data>","<timestamp>","<delivered true>","<$groupID>")
